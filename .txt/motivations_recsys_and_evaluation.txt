A well-cited study (over 2000 citations so far!) by Iyengar and Lepper ran an experiment where they had two stands of jam on two different days.
One stand had 24 varieties of jam while the second had only six. The stand with 24 varieties of jam only converted 3% of the customers to a sale, while the stand with only six varieties converted 30% of the customers.
